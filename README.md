- 
 Exercise 1
Create a table containing your three favorite images, songs and videos on the internet (that are safe for work ;) )
 in a 3x3 layout. Use best practices when using images, audio and video tags.
- So I created a table with 3x3 rows and addes the images using the <img>-tag, the videos with <iframe> and audio using <audio>
